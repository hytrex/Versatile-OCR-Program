# v2.0_initial Update
**Fix Docker permission instability + optimize memory usage in advanced_ocr.py**

⸻

### Summary

This patch brings two major improvements to the **Versatile-OCR-Program**:

1. **Fixes a Docker permission loss issue on Vertex AI / Jupyter environments**

2. **Optimizes memory usage in `advanced_ocr.py` to handle large, image-heavy PDFs more efficiently**

---

### [1] Fix: Docker Permission Instability After Kernel Interruptions

**Problem**  
-  Docker commands would fail with `Permission denied`, after a Jupyter kernel interruption (due to memory spikes or manual stops).

**Root Cause**  
- The `jupyter` user was not persistently recognized as a member of the `docker` group unless the machine was rebooted.

- This behavior is specific to Jupyter-based environments (e.g., Vertex AI, Colab Pro VMs) where group permissions are reset per session.

**Failed Attempts**  
- Adding `sudo` inside `subprocess.run()` failed due to the absence of a TTY.

- Using `shell=True` caused unpredictable behavior and was ultimately removed.

**Final Fix**  
- The `jupyter` user was permanently added to the `docker` group:
  ```bash
  sudo usermod -aG docker jupyter
  sudo reboot

	
  •	All subprocess calls to Docker now use plain docker run without sudo.

Impact
	•	Prevents permission loss on session or kernel restart.
	•	Ensures stable and persistent Docker access inside Jupiter Notebooks.
	•	Simplifies code and avoids reliance on elevated permissions.

[2] Feature: Memory Optimization in advanced_ocr.py

The advanced_ocr.py module was refactored to significantly reduce memory usage without changing core functionality or output format.

Key Optimizations:
	
  1.	Garbage Collection
	•	Added gc.collect() after large memory operations.
	•	Imported the gc module for explicit cleanup.
	
  2.	Image Processing
	•	Resized large images before feeding them into OCR pipelines.
	•	Applied JPEG compression with quality 85 to reduce in-memory buffer size.
	•	Used downscaled thumbnails for hash operations.
	•	Released all image buffers immediately after use.
	
  3.	Memory Management
	•	Explicitly used del to release large objects.
	•	Used .copy() after cropping to avoid memory leaks from image views.
	•	Switched to page-by-page PDF parsing instead of loading entire files.
	
  4.	Efficient String Building
	•	Replaced inefficient += concatenations with list-based string assembly using ''.join().
	•	Split large text blocks into smaller, manageable chunks.
	
  5.	API Handling Improvements
	•	Reduced request payload size for external API calls (e.g., Gemini).
	•	Cleaned up response objects immediately after use to free memory.

Impact
	•	Handles high-resolution, multi-page PDFs (100–200+ pages) without exceeding memory limits.
	•	Prevents kernel crashes on large inputs.
	•	Keeps behavior and output identical to the original.

Recommendation

Use this update if you’re running the Versatile-OCR-Program in a Jupyter-based cloud environment (e.g., Vertex AI, GCP Notebook, Colab Pro).
It ensures both system stability and memory efficiency — especially when processing large, image-rich PDF documents.
